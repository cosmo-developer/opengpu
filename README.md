OpenGPU is an API designed to make use of the power of GPUs for scientific computation. It is built using OpenGL and GLFW, and it abstracts away the complexities of these libraries, allowing developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications.

* At the core of OpenGPU is Glad, a library that generates function pointers for OpenGL. This means that developers do not need to worry about the specifics of OpenGL implementation, but can still use its powerful features for scientific computation.

* With OpenGPU, developers can easily create and manipulate textures, buffers, and shaders. These are the fundamental building blocks of any OpenGL application, and they are used extensively in scientific computation. By abstracting away the complexities of OpenGL, OpenGPU makes it easy to use these building blocks in C++.

* OpenGPU also provides an easy-to-use API for loading and manipulating data. This is crucial for scientific computation, where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly. OpenGPU allows developers to load data into GPU memory and manipulate it using shaders, which can significantly speed up computation time.

* Overall, OpenGPU provides a powerful yet accessible tool for scientific computation on the GPU. Its use of OpenGL and GLFW, combined with the abstraction provided by Glad, make it easy to use for C++ developers. Whether you are working with simulations, visualizations, or machine learning, OpenGPU can help you make the most of the power of your GPU.
